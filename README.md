A WordPress plugin that adds a shortcode to display other pages in a page.

Usage:

In the WordPress editor, typing `[otherpages ids="123,124"]` will insert the content of two posts (those with post ID 123 and 124) into your post.

Posts inserted in this way will be surrounded in a `div`. If you add the `classname` shortcode attribute, you can add a CSS class to that div.
